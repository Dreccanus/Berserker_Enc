# Berserk Encoder

The main goal of this encoder is to encode the file or the string with
many multiple others encoders using the random fun and get the output as an hex
file and reverset and get it as a binary file and reverset and at list change the
zeros and the ones with random letters multiple times so this gonna make it
harder for anyone to see the original file or string !
